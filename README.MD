# Machine Vision with Raspberry Pi üçá

Welcome to my Machine Vision with Raspberry Pi repository :octocat:! This repository will be used throughout our "Training of Trainer's" session. We will be using a headless Raspberry Pi in this session. What does "headless" mean? You won't need to bring an additional monitor, keyboard or mouse! Just bring your laptop, SD card, Raspberry Pi and power adapter.

Less hassle I hope! :star:

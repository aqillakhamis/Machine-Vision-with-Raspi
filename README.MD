# Machine Vision with Raspberry Pi üçá

Welcome to my **Machine Vision with Raspberry Pi** repository :octocat:! 

This repository will be used throughout our "Training of Trainer's" session. We will be using a headless Raspberry Pi in this session. What does **"headless"** mean? You won't need to bring an additional:  

- :no_entry_sign: monitor
- :no_entry_sign: keyboard
- :no_entry_sign: mouse

Just bring your laptop, SD card, Raspberry Pi and power adapter!

Less hassle I hope. Let's rockin :rocket: get ready to dive into the world of **Machine Vision with Raspberry Pi!** :sparkles:
